MANCHESTER CITY HAVE BEEN CAUTIONED AGAINST THE INTRODUCTION OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY, WHICH A CIVIL RIGHTS GROUP SAYS WOULD RISK "NORMALISING A MASS SURVEILLANCE TOOL".
THE REIGNING PREMIER LEAGUE CHAMPIONS ARE CONSIDERING INTRODUCING TECHNOLOGY ALLOWING FANS TO GET INTO THE ETIHAD STADIUM MORE QUICKLY BY SHOWING THEIR FACES INSTEAD OF TICKETS, ACCORDING TO THE SUNDAY TIMES.

THE TEAM BEHIND BLINK IDENTITY HAVE SPENT THE LAST DECADE CREATING LARGE-SCALE BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR THE US DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, ACCORDING TO ITS WEBSITE. LAST YEAR LIVE NATION, THE COMPANY THAT OWNS TICKETMASTER, ANNOUNCED INVESTMENT IN BLINK IDENTITY AS PART OF PLANS TO REPLACE PAPER TICKETS WITH FACIAL RECOGNITION.
A SOURCE AT MANCHESTER CITY SAID REPORTS OF A PILOT FACIAL RECOGNITION SCHEME WERE PREMATURE AND THERE WAS NO SUCH PLAN IN PLACE. THEY SAID THE CLUB WOULD ALWAYS BE "OPEN TO EXPLORING NEW AND APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS TO IMPROVE FANS' EXPERIENCE AT THE STADI
