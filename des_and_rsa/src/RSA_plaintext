As the attack was in progress, the bombs began to fall in earnest, the officers began shouting 
orders for everyone to head to the nearby rifle range to be issued firearms and ammunition.

About this time, the men at Schofield could look down towards the harbor and view theterrible 
sight unfolding as the attacking planes began to wreak their havoc among the anchored ships in 
the harbor. They could see what appeared to be a "mist" or "fog" rising from the harbor area. 
Jacques did not elaborate on this (quite possibly results of the bombing). 

After the men were inthe process of being armed,the men who were anti-aircraft trained, such as 
Jacques, were ordered to head to the mouth of the harbor to man the battery of anti-aircraft guns 
(3-inch) locatedthere. The guns were situated in a "firing pit" of sorts that allowed for the 
weapon to rotate to follow attacking aircraft. 

Upon reaching this assignment, the men began firing on the attacking aircraft (it is assumed that 
at this time, the attack had entered into the second wave of aircraft). 

The weapons were fired andtargets were plentiful, indeed. The firing was to the extent that the 
barrels became red hot and the guns began jamming. 
 
Some of thejamming guns would actually"buck like a bucking bronco" and literally fall back onto 
the gunners in the firing pits! The officers and noncoms on hand began issuing orders to exit the 
firing pits for fear of the weapons exploding and injuring or killing the men in the pits. Jacques 
did as he wastold, and got out of the firing pit, and began to run,falling into a large hole. He 
recalls being dazed, stunned and appeared to have fallen into a large "black hole" in which he had 
to climb out.(bomb crater?)
