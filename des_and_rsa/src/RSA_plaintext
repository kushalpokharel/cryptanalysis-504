As the attack was in progres
s, the bombs began to fall 
in earnest, the officers be
gan shouting 
orders for ev
eryone to head to the nearb
y rifle range to be issued 
firearms and ammunition.

A
bout this time, the men at S
chofield could look down tow
ards the harbor and view the
terrible 
sight unfolding a
s the attacking planes bega
n to wreak their havoc amon
g the anchored ships in 
th
e harbor. They could see wh
at appeared to be a "mist" o
r "fog" rising from the har
bor area. 
Jacques did not e
laborate on this (quite pos
sibly results of the bombin
g). 

After the men were in
the process of being armed,
the men who were anti-aircr
aft trained, such as 
Jacque
s, were ordered to head to 
the mouth of the harbor to 
man the battery of anti-air
craft guns 
(3-inch) located
there. The guns were situat
ed in a "firing pit" of sor
ts that allowed for the 
we
apon to rotate to follow att
acking aircraft. 

Upon reac
hing this assignment, the m
en began firing on the atta
cking aircraft (it is assume
d that 
at this time, the a
ttack had entered into the 
second wave of aircraft). 


The weapons were fired and
targets were plentiful, ind
eed. The firing was to the 
extent that the 
barrels be
came red hot and the guns be
gan jamming. 
 
Some of the
jamming guns would actually
"buck like a bucking bronco
" and literally fall back on
to 
the gunners in the firi
ng pits! The officers and n
oncoms on hand began issuin
g orders to exit the 
firin
g pits for fear of the weap
ons exploding and injuring 
or killing the men in the p
its. Jacques 
did as he was
told, and got out of the fi
ring pit, and began to run,
falling into a large hole. 
He 
recalls being dazed, stu
nned and appeared to have f
allen into a large "black ho
le" in which he had 
to cli
mb out.(bomb crater?)
